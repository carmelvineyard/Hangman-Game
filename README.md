# Board Game Hangman
### Where all the answers are names of board games

## Technologies used:
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript

## How to use:
* Click [here](https://carmelvineyard.github.io/Hangman-Game/) to navigate to the game.
* Click the blue button for a word to guess.
* Press keys on your keyboard to guess letters (don't worry about upper/lowercase).
* Wrong guesses make the number of guesses go down, correct guesses do not change it.
* When you either complete the word or run out of guesses you will see an alert to mark the occasion.
* After clicking OK on the alert, either the Wins or Losses numbers will increase by one to reflect the previous result.
* Click the blue button for a new word.
* *Play again! Have fun!*
* Refresh the page to reset the Wins and Losses numbers.

## Future improvements:
* A modal to replace the alert
